# üéÆ Video Game Recommendation System

This project develops a **recommendation system for video games** using sales, ratings, and metadata such as platform, genre, and publisher.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Loaded dataset containing sales, ratings, and game metadata.  
   - Fixed data types (e.g., `User_Score`) and handled missing values.  
   - Treated outliers using **Winsorization**.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzed regional sales trends (NA, EU, JP, Global).  
   - Reviewed platform and genre popularity.  
   - Explored relationships between **critic scores, user scores, and sales**.  

3. **Recommendation System**  
   - Built a **content-based recommendation system** using similarity of features (genre, rating, platform).  
   - Incorporated user and critic scores for ranking recommendations.  
   - Suggested top-N games for players based on preferences.

## üìà Results and Conclusion
